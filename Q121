//Q121: Write a C program that creates a text file named info.txt in write mode. The program should take the user’s name and age as input, and write them to the file using fprintf(). After writing, display a message confirming that the data was successfully saved.

/*
Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
Name: Rahul, Age: 23
Output 1:
File created successfully! Data written to info.txt

*/
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *file_pointer;
    char name[50];
    int age;

    // Open the file named "info.txt" in write mode ("w")
    // If the file does not exist, it will be created. If it exists, its content will be overwritten.
    file_pointer = fopen("info.txt", "w");

    if (file_pointer == NULL) {
        printf("Error: Could not open the file.\n");
        return 1; // Exit the program with an error code
    }

    // Take user input for name and age
    printf("Enter Name: ");
    // Read a string (up to 49 characters) from standard input
    scanf("%s", name); 

    printf("Enter Age: ");
    // Read an integer from standard input
    scanf("%d", &age);

    // Write the name and age to the file using fprintf()
    // The format string specifies how the data should be saved (e.g., "Name: Rahul, Age: 23")
    fprintf(file_pointer, "Name: %s, Age: %d\n", name, age);

    // Close the file
    fclose(file_pointer);

    // Display confirmation message
    printf("File created successfully! Data written to info.txt\n");

    return 0; // Exit the program successfully
}
