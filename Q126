Q126: Ask the user for a filename. Check if it exists by trying to open it in read mode. If the file pointer is NULL, print an error message; otherwise, read and display its content.

/*
Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
Filename: sample.txt (File Exists: Yes)
Output 1:
File opened successfully.
(Displays file content)

Input 2:
Filename: nofile.txt (File Exists: No)
Output 2:
Error: File does not exist!
